title: Clients and Plugins
---

Flipper was designed with extensibility in mind from the start, to enable engineers to quickly build quality, easy-to-use tools for their own needs and applications.

In addition to building plugins for the existing platforms, you can also extend the capabilities of Flipper to other platforms by conforming to the `FlipperClient` API. After this, you can make use of the existing desktop plugins by writing client plugins that conform to the same API.
