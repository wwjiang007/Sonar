Starting with React Native 0.62, after generating your project with `react-native init`, the Flipper integration is ready out of the box for debug builds:

* For Android, start the Flipper Desktop application, and start your project using `yarn android`. Your application will appear in Flipper.
* For iOS, run `pod install` once in the `ios` directory of your project. After that, run `yarn ios` and start Flipper. Your application will show up in Flipper.

By default, the following plugins will be available:

* Layout Inspector
* Network
* Databases
* Images
* Shared Preferences
* Crash Reporter
* React DevTools
* Metro Logs

Additional plugins can be installed through the plugin manager.

To create your own plugins and integrate with Flipper using JavaScript, check out our [writing plugins for React Native](../tutorial/react-native) tutorial!

To update the Flipper SDK in your project, you bump the version in the `ios/Podfile` and `android/gradle.properties` files of your project.

## Manual Setup

If you are not using a default React Native template or cannot use the upgrade tool,
you can find instructions for how to integate Flipper into your projects in these guides:

- [React Native for Android](react-native-android)
- [React Native for iOS](react-native-ios)
